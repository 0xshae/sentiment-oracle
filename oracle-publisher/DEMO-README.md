# Sentiment Oracle Demo Results

This document explains the demonstration of the Sentiment Oracle cryptographic functionality.

## Demo Summary

We successfully demonstrated the core functionality of our Oracle Publisher:

1. **Keypair Generation**: Created an ED25519 keypair for signing sentiment data
2. **Data Hashing**: Hashed sentiment data to create a fixed-length message for signing
3. **Signing**: Signed the hash with a private key
4. **Verification**: Verified the signature against the public key
5. **Tamper Detection**: Demonstrated how the system detects data tampering

## Files Generated

- `oracle_keypair.json` - The ED25519 keypair used for signing
- `signed_sentiment.json` - The sentiment data with its signature
- `signed_sentiment_original.json` - Backup of the original signed data

## Tamper Detection Test

We demonstrated the tamper detection by:

1. Saving a copy of the original signed data
2. Modifying the sentiment label from "POSITIVE" to "NEGATIVE"
3. Attempting to verify the modified data with the original signature
4. Confirming that verification fails when data is tampered with

### Hash Comparison Results

Original data hash: `11a750d2852d8f35ff9d09349c4945a2253a16367195c9a915442c2829a41224`
Tampered data hash: `f2ab405c1dd757efce318ebe500af399b2ab089631b329f4865bb0017eacdbe1`

The hash values are completely different, which is why the signature verification fails.

## Conclusion

This demonstration successfully proves the core concepts behind the Sentiment Oracle:

1. Data signed by the oracle's private key can be verified using the oracle's public key
2. Any alteration to the signed data will cause verification to fail
3. This ensures data integrity and authenticity for consumers of the sentiment data

In a production environment, these cryptographic operations would take place on the Solana blockchain, with the signed data stored on-chain. The Python demo provides an easy way to understand the cryptographic principles without requiring Solana deployment.
